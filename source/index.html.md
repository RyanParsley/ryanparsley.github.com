I’m a graphic designer with a passion for front end development. I have a formal design background coupled with the technical chops to build my own solutions. Additionally, I’ve spoken at conferences and meetups where I have been a proponent of such topics as: HTML5, Sass, web standards and designing in the browser. Beyond the web, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects from print to mobile apps.
